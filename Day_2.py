# If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.

bill = input("What is the amount of the bill?\nÂ£")

tip = input("What percentage tip would you like to give?\n10%, 12% or 15% \n")

amount = float(bill) * ((int(tip)/100)+1) / int(people)

#  Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#  Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60
